Thomas Paine wrote in COMMON SENSE:


Government by kings was first introduced into the world by the
Heathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was
the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the
promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their
deceased kings, and the Christian world hath improved on the plan by
doing the same to their living ones.

How impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in
the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust!

As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be
justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be
defended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the
Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly
disapproves of government by kings.

All anti-monarchial parts of scripture have been very smoothly
glossed over in monarchial governments, but they undoubtedly merit
the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form.
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's is the scriptural
doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchial government,
for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of
vassalage to the Romans.

Near three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the
creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king.
Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases,
where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administered
by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it
was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the
Lords of Hosts.

And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous homage which is
paid to the persons of kings he need not wonder, that the Almighty,
ever jealous of his honor, should disapprove of a form of government
which so impiously invades the prerogative of heaven.
...
The children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon
marched against them with a small army, and victory, through the
divine interposition, decided in his favor. The Jews, elate with
success, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed
making him a king, saying, "Rule thou over us, thou and thy son and
thy son's son."

Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only, but
an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his soul replied, "I
will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, THE LORD
SHALL RULE OVER YOU."

Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honor
but denies their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them
with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the positive style
of a prophet charges them with disaffection to their proper
sovereign, the King of Heaven.

About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into
the same error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous
customs of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but
so it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons,
who were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an
abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, "Behold thou art old
and thy sons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us
like all the other nations."

And here we cannot but observe that their motives were bad, viz.,
that they might be like unto other nations, i.e., the Heathen,
whereas their true glory laid in being as much unlike them as
possible. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, give us a
king to judge us; and Samuel prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord said
unto Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say
to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me,
THEN I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. According to all the works which 
they have done since the day; wherewith they brought them up out of 
Egypt, even unto this day; wherewith they have forsaken me and served
other Gods; so do they also unto you.

"Now therefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit, protest solemnly
unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over
them," i.e., not of any particular king, but the general manner of
the kings of the earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after.
And notwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of
manners, the character is still in fashion.

And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people, that
asked of him a king. And he said, "This shall be the manner of the
king that shall reign over you:

"He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his
chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his
chariots [this description agrees with the present mode of
impressing men] and he will appoint him captains over thousands and
captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground and to
reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
instruments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters to be
confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers [this describes the
expense and luxury as well as the oppression of kings] and he will
take your fields and your olive yards, even the best of them, and
give them to his servants; and he will take the tenth of your seed,
and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his
servants [by which we see that bribery, corruption, and favoritism
are the standing vices of kings] and he will take the tenth of your
men servants, and your maid servants, and your goodliest young men
and your asses, and put them to his work; and he will take the tenth
of your sheep, ---and ye shall be his servants--- and ye shall cry
out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen, AND
THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY."

This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do the
characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either
sanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the
high encomium given of David takes no notice of him officially as a
king, but only as a man after God's own heart.

Nevertheless the People refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and
they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we may be like
all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before
us and fight our battles."

Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he set
before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and seeing
them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, "I will call unto the
Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain [which then was a
punishment, being the time of wheat harvest] that ye may perceive
and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the
sight of the Lord, IN ASKING YOU A KING."

So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain
that day, and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And
all the people said unto Samuel, "Pray for thy servants unto the Lord
thy God that we die not, for WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL,
TO ASK A KING."

These portions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of
no equivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his
protest against monarchial government is true, or the scripture is
false. And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much
of kingcraft, as priestcraft in withholding the scripture from the
public in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is the
Popery of government.

HONORABLE MENTIONS


/*
  It seems appropriate to mention a few other people who deserve mentioning.

  A moment of silence for "Jolly Good Fellow" Bernard von NotHaus, 
  the founder of NORFED who was recently (and wrongfully) convicted of
  "domestic terrorism."

  For history, I will reproduce a few gloating FBI quotes:

  "Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country
   are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism."
   ...
  "We are determined to meet these threats through infiltration,
   disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge
   the legitimacy of our democratic form of government."
   ...
  "While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve
   violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and
   present danger to the economic stability of this country."

 // -----------------------------------------------

  Speaking of wrongful prosecution...

  Tip of the hat to Dr. Douglas Jackson for his sacrifices and
  accomplishments.
  May this software protect future innovators from persecution,
  in a diversity of jurisdictions.
  
 // -----------------------------------------------

  Aaron Swartz, in the depths of depression, was driven to suicide by
  unfair prosecution. He didn't beat, rob, or murder anyone. He was
  someone who fought for the good of all mankind. His girlfriend,
  Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, said of him:
  
  "I've never met anyone so single-minded about changing the world."

 // -----------------------------------------------

  To all hackers who DDoS -- please consider building something instead.
  
  "Strike the root."
  
  (You won't do anyone any good in prison.)

 // -----------------------------------------------

  Thank you to David Chaum, for inventing digital cash in the first place.

  Kudos to David Wagner, and Ben Laurie, who brought us Lucre.

  Kudos to Ian Grigg for his many advancements in financial cryptography.  
  Check out his website at http://iang.org/

  J. Orlin Grabbe and his writings have been inspirational. He will be
  missed. His DMT as well as critiques of it were useful to me.
  http://www.orlingrabbe.com/
  
  Thank you to Richard Stallman: His concept of of the GPL license has
  made an historic and immeasurable contribution to human liberty.
  
  Thank you also to Satoshi Nakamoto, for developing the world's first
  censorship-resistant digital asset and currency (Bitcoin.)

  Kudos to Phil Zimmermann for writing and releasing PGP. The man who put
  power into the hands of the people. Many people in corrupt jurisdictions
  now have PGP to thank for their lives. Let's do the same for their money.

  Bill St. Clair, whose Truledger was truly inspirational. Check out
  Truledger at http://truledger.com/

  Patrick Chkoreff, whose Loom is operational and is what showed me the
  idea of separation of powers. Check out https://Loom.cc for more info.

  Andrew McMeikan's PKTP, which can be found here:  http://pktp.co.cc/
 
  Ryan Fugger's Ripple project: http://ripple-project.org/

  Jim Bell, of course. His story is partially the reason for this software.
  I still don't understand why he was stink-bombing IRS offices instead of
  writing code. But he definitely made his mark. 

  Tim May for writing the Cyphernomicon. (Google it.)

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
    as part of a Larger Work; and

(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
Contributor:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
    Version); or

(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
    its Contributions.

This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

2.4. Subsequent Licenses

No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).

2.5. Representation

Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.

2.6. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.7. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

*                                                                      *

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
