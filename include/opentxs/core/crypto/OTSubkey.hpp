#include "OTKeyCredential.hpp"

// A nym contains a list of master credentials, via OTCredential.
// The whole purpose of a Nym is to be an identity, which can have
// master credentials.
//
// Each credential is like a master key for the Nym's identity,
// which can issue its own subkeys.
//
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
// Not all subcredentials are a subkey. For example, you might have a
// subcredential that uses Google Authenticator, and thus doesn't contain
// any keys, because it uses alternate methods for its own authentication.
//
// Each OTCredential contains a "master" subkey, and a list of subcredentials
// (some of them subkeys) signed by that master.
//
// The same class (subcredential/subkey) is used because there are master
// credentials and subcredentials, so we're using inheritance for
// "subcredential" and "subkey" to encapsulate the credentials, so we don't have
// to repeat code across both.
// We're using a "has-a" model here, since the OTCredential "has a" master
// subkey, and also "has a" list of subcredentials, some of which are subkeys.
//
// Each subcredential must be signed by the subkey that is the master key.
// Each subkey has 3 key pairs: encryption, signing, and authentication.
//
// Each key pair has 2 OTAsymmetricKeys (public and private.)
//
// I'm thinking that the Nym should also have a key pair (for whatever is
// its current key pair, copied from its credentials.)
//
// the master should never be able to do any actions except for sign subkeys.
// the subkeys, meanwhile should only be able to do actions, and not issue
// any new keys.
